More specifically, it will provide data that will enable ice-sheet modellers to improve their predictions of the future contribution of the GrIS to sea level rise in response to a warming world. To achieve this aim requires a dedicated field campaign to the GrIS to investigate seasonal ice flow dynamics and runoff processes along flow parallel transects extending from the ice sheet margin to the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) at both tidewater and land-terminating glaciers. The greatest store of fresh water in the northern hemisphere - equivalent to 7m of eustatic sea level rise - is held within the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), and yet its present and future contribution to sea level is poorly constrained (IPCC, 2007). Recent observations suggest that mass loss near the margin of the GrIS is accelerating through a combination of increased surface melting (e.g. Steffen et al, 2004) and dynamic thinning (e.g. Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006). However, the key processes controlling dynamic thinning have yet to be identified (Alley et al, 2005), and in consequence, are not incorporated in the ice-sheet models which form the basis of the IPCC sea level projections. This in part reflects the fact that the satellite data that has revealed the widespread speed-up of glaciers cannot be acquired at the temporal resolution needed to resolve the causal mechanisms. Our present understanding of GrIS mass balance is especially complicated by uncertainties in the sensitivity of ice-marginal dynamics to changes in melt-water induced lubrication resulting from penetration of supraglacial melt-waters to the glacier bed (Zwally et al, 2002). Recent observations on the GrIS Shepherd et al, in review) reveal, over a five day period in July, a strong and direct coupling between surface hydrology and dynamics where diurnal fluctuations in velocity of &gt;100% occur and where maximum daily velocities scale with temperature. Such observations confirm the need to acquire hydrological and dynamic data at high temporal (sub-hourly) and spatial resolution throughout the year to parameterise the coupling between ice melting and flow. This project will collect data at the necessary resolution to quantify the relationship between melt-water production and ice sheet dynamics thereby enabling ice-sheet modellers to improve predictions of the GrIS's response to climate change. We will conduct ground based experiments along two flow-parallel transects at the western margin of the GrIS in adjacent land and marine terminating drainage basins to address the following objectives: 1. Is there a temporal and spatial pattern to any hydrology-dynamic link associated with the seasonal evolution of the supraglacial drainage system (including supraglacial lakes)? 2. Over what area does surface generated meltwater penetrate to the base of the ice sheet? 3. Is there a relationship between the volume of meltwater input at the glacier surface and the magnitude of the dynamic response? 4. Do tidewater and land-terminating glaciers behave differently during the course of a melt-season? Field campaigns will be undertaken during 2008 and 2009 to determine: 1) The rate, extent and duration of melt. 2) The temporal and spatial variations in water volumes stored in and released from supraglacial lakes and delivered to freely draining moulins. 3) The seasonal, diurnal and hourly variations in ice dynamics. 4) The variations in proglacial discharge and water chemistry (at Russell Glacier). As a result of our work, it will be possible to determine whether ice dynamics at the margin of the GrIS is significantly affected by lubrication of the glacier bed following the drainage of surface derived meltwaters. Our results will be delivered to ice sheet modellers to help them constrain predictions for the future of the GrIS","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F021399/1","grantId":"NE/F021399/1","fundValue":"222231","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The data generated which shows the relationship between the volume of meltwater input at the glacier surface and the magnitude of the dynamic response has now been used by the ice sheet modelling community, through the EU funded Ice2Sea consortium.

This expansion occurs episodically in response to the drainage of surface meltwaters into a hitherto inefficient subglacial drainage system as new input locations become active progressively further upglacier (Objective 2); this system is similar to that observed at Alpine glaciers. These observations provide the first synopsis of seasonal hydrological behaviour in the ablation zone of the GrIS (Bartholomew 2011, GRL).\n\nThe effect of this meltwater penetration to the ice sheet bed is to perturb the subglacial hydrology at the ice-bed interface causing the ice sheet to flow faster in summer with substantial increases in summer motion, of up to 250%, compared with winter background. These motion variations display an upglacier evolution over the course of the summer, with initial velocity enhancement occurring earliest at sites close to the ice margin (Objective 1). The pattern of ice motion and hydrological characteristics of the proglacial runoff in the land-terminating margin confirms that the seasonal evolution in the subglacial drainage system controls basal sliding through hydraulic-ice dynamic forcing mechanisms comparable to those observed at smaller valley glaciers (Bartholomew 2010, Nature Geoscience). Our findings show that the relationship between melt and ice motion varies both at-a-site and between sites during the melt season. At our land terminating transect, we find a strong positive correlation between annual ablation and changes in summer ice motion (Objective 3), with sites nearest the ice sheet margin experiencing greater summer acceleration in ice motion (15–18%) than those above 1000 m elevation (3–8%) (Bartholomew, 2011, EPSL). However, we subsequently find no significant correlation between summer surface melt-rate and annual ice flow (Sole, 2013, GRL). For example, despite record summer melting in 2012, the subsequently reduced winter ice motion resulted in 6% less net annual ice motion in 2012 than in the ‘normal’ 2009 melt-year (Tedstone, 2013, PNAS). Our findings suggest that surface melt–induced acceleration of land-terminating regions of the ice sheet will remain insignificant even under extreme melting scenarios.\n\nAt our tidewater glacier transect, we find that &amp;amp;gt;35 km from the ice-margin, seasonal and shorter–time scale ice flow variations are controlled by surface melt–induced changes in subglacial hydrology but the net effect of the summer speed variations on annual motion is small (~1%) (Sole, 2011, JGR) (Objective 4). \n\nThe observations of efficient meltwater routing at the glacier bed have profound implications for ice-sheet erosion. We estimate erosion under the catchment occurs at ~4.8 &plusmn; 2.6 mm a-1, 1 – 2 orders of magnitude greater than previous estimates of erosion rate beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results suggest that where surface meltwaters are able to access the bed, the rate of erosion by ice sheets is in keeping with the rapid erosion observed at temperate alpine glaciers (Cowton, 2012, Geology). Our findings are significant because they provide a conceptual framework to understand the impact of hydrologically-forced velocity variations on the future mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In particular, the data generated which shows the relationship between the volume of meltwater input at the glacier surface and the magnitude of the dynamic response has now been used by the ice sheet modelling community, through the EU funded Ice2Sea consortium. The data has been used to improve parameterisations of a sliding law which has been incorporated into a suite of models with relevance to the IPCC for estimating the contribution from Greenland to sea level rise in a warming world (Shannon et al, 2013).
