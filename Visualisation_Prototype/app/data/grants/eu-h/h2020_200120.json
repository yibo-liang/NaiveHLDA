{"id":"200120","title":"Green Awareness in Action","abstractText":"The GAIA project focuses on the educational community; faculty, staff, students and parents at all levels of education: primary/secondary/high schools and universities. Targeting Energy Efficiency in the context of the educational community is clearly very important due to a number of reasons since raising awareness among young people and changing their behaviour and habits concerning energy usage is key to achieving sustained energy reductions and it will also indirectly affect their immediate family environment, while achieving energy reduction in the school buildings. GAIA will create an innovative ICT ecosystem (including web-based, mobile, social and sensing elements) tailored specifically for school environments, taking into account both the users (faculty, staff, students, parents) and buildings (schools, universities, homes) that will motivate and support citizens' behavioural change to achieve greater energy efficiency. GAIA will include also a set of pilots in different countries. GAIA will directly educate over 6.900 users, influence and attempt to transform their behaviour through a series of trials conducted in the educational environment and in homes. We expect a larger number of people to be informed about the activities of GAIA and be positively affected towards an energy-efficient behaviour transformation.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"696029","fundValue":"1775707","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
