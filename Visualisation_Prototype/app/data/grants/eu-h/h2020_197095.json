{"id":"197095","title":"HIGH SPECIFIC ENERGY ALUMINIUM-ION RECHARGEABLE  DECENTRALIZED ELECTRICITY GENERATION SOURCES","abstractText":"The overall objective of the ALION project is to develop aluminium-ion battery technology for energy storage application in\ndecentralised electricity generation sources. ALION pursues an integral approach comprising electroactive materials based on “rocking chair” mechanism, robust ionic liquid-based electrolytes as well as novel cell and battery concepts, finally resulting in a technology with much lower cost, improved performance, safety and reliability with respect to current energy storage solutions (e.g. Pumped hydro storage, Compressed air energy storage, Li-ion battery, Redox Flow Battery...). The project covers the whole value chain from materials and component manufacturers, battery assembler, until the technology validation in specific electric microgrid system including renewable energy source (i.e. mini wind turbine, photovoltaic system…). Thus, the final objective of this project is to obtain an Al-ion battery module validated in a relevant environment, with a specific energy of 400 W.h/kg, a voltage of 48V and a cycle life of 3000 cycles.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"646286","fundValue":"7223551,25","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2019-05-31","dataset":"h2020"}
