{"id":"199975","title":"Research capacity building through improved knowledge exchange and twinning frameworks for the Centre of Excellence in Translational Medicine","abstractText":"The project will enhance Estonian research potential and capacities in translational medicine with particular focus on immunological diseases and neurological disorders, which represent a challenging burden on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Strategic partnership with UCL and KI - both international leaders in medical research and education, enables developing long-lasting knowledge exchange framework for allowing University of Tartu (UT) to capitalise on its current achievements and deliver a new internationally-leading European Centre of Translational Medicine (CETM).\n\nThe specific objectives of the project are to:\n1. measurably and significantly enhance the overall scientific R&I capacity of UT and Estonia in the field of translational medicine\n2. raise the research profile of academic staff\n3. strengthen UT´s networking capacity, visibility and credibility\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the twinning activities with UCL and KI will:\n- create a strategic framework for sustainable development (long-term development plan, links with industrial partners, public funding and investment strategy, IPR strategy)\n- enhance UT´s research capacity in 6 key areas/techniques (6 joint summer schools/seminars, 11 medium-term visits, 38 short bidirectional visits, participation in conferences)\n- develop transferable skills of UT´s research staff (training seminars in networking/H2020 participating, IPR, research commercialisation, ethics, communication skills and doctoral training)\n- extend UT´s strategic partnerships and visibility among the professional community, industry, policy-makers and public (strategic networking, publications, science days, open workshops, targeted stakeholders)\n\nAs the expected result of the CETM-TWIN project, the twinning activities between the consortium will lead to research improving synergy that supports building one of the leading translational medicine competency centres in the North-Eastern European region by 2020.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"692202","fundValue":"1072437,5","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
