{"id":"194604","title":"SPP Regions","abstractText":"The SPP Regions project is aimed at promoting strong networking and collaboration at both the European and sub-national regional level on sustainable and innovative procurement (SPP/PPI), to help promote and embed capacity building and knowledge transfer. \n\nAt the regional level networking will be promoted to build capacities and transfer skills in sustainable and innovative procurement implementation, and to collaborate directly on tendering for eco-innovative solutions. New networks will be established, or existing networks strengthened in 7 European regions (Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Torino, Bristol, Barcelona, West France and Gabrovo). Networking activities will include an intensive capacity building programme and collaboration on at least 6 tenders per region - 42 in total.\n\nAt the European level a Sustainable Procurement and Innovation Network will be launched, expanding on the existing Procura Campaign. In-depth research will be conducted into European best practice relating to a series of key SPP/PPI topics (market engagement, life cycle costing, output/performance-based specifications, circular procurement) by a series of experts in consultation with network participants. A series of European seminars and expert workshops will be organised, together with an ongoing webinar series, and the annual presentation of a PPI award for European best practice.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"649718","fundValue":"1498738,75","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","dataset":"h2020"}
