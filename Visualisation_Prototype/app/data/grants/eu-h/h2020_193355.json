{"id":"193355","title":"Building sustainable logistics through trusted collaborative networks across the entire supply chain","abstractText":"NEXTRUST objective is to increase efficiency and sustainability in logistics by developing interconnected trusted collaborative networks along the entire supply chain. These trusted networks, built horizontally and vertically, will fully integrate shippers, LSPs and intermodal operators as equal partners. To reach a high level of sustainability, we will not only bundle freight volumes, but shift them off the road to intermodal rail and waterway. NEXTRUST will build these trusted networks ideally bottom up, with like-minded partners, adding multiple layers of transport flows that have been de-coupled and then re-connected more effectively along the supply chain. We will develop C-ITS cloud based smart visibility software to support the re-engineering of the networks, improving real-time utilization of transport assets. NEXTRUST will focus on research activities that create stickiness for collaboration in the market, validated through pilot cases in live conditions. The action engages major shippers as partners (Beiersdorf, Borealis, Colruyt, Delhaize, KC, Mondelez, Panasonic, Philips, Unilever) owning freight volumes well over 1.000.000 annual truck movements across Europe, plus SME shippers and LSPs with a track record in ICT innovation. The pilot cases cover the entire scope of the call and cover a broad cross section of entire supply chain (from raw material to end-consumers) for multiple industries. The creation and validation of trusted collaborative networks will be market oriented and implemented at an accelerated rate for high impact. We expect our pilot cases to reduce deliveries by 20%-40% and with modal shift to reduce GHG emissions by 40%-70%. Load factors will increase by 50%-60% given our emphasis on back-load/modal shift initiatives. NEXTRUST will achieve a high impact with improved asset utilization and logistics cost efficiency, creating a sustainable, competitive arena for European logistics that will be an inspirational example for the market.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"635874","fundValue":"18106751","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-10-31","dataset":"h2020"}
