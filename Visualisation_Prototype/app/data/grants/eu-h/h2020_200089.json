{"id":"200089","title":"Bioenergy Sustaining the Future (BESTF) 3","abstractText":"This ERA-NET Co-fund will bring together a number of national and transnational organisations with an interest in promoting the greater use of bioenergy. It follows on from two previous BESTF ERA-NET Plus initiatives launched in 2013 and, like its predecessors, aims to kick-start large scale investment in close-to-market implementation of bioenergy, thereby helping to achieve the key objectives of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI) Implementation Plan  and the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan.\nThe EIBI aims to boost the contribution of sustainable bioenergy to the 2020 climate and energy objectives. \nThis proposal addresses the need for integrated action across Europe to promote the development of bioenergy demonstrators across a number of technologies by coordinating research and development projects and providing a financial mechanism to support projects that are close to commercialisation.\nThe overall aim for this third BESTF ERA-NET is to implement a joint programme for bioenergy demonstration projects to demonstrate enhanced bioenergy technologies that will help Europe progress towards achieving its 2016 and 2020 targets. It will leverage public-private partnerships to manage the risks and share the financing of close to market bioenergy projects. \n\nThe key objectives of BESTF3 are:\n1.To implement a single collaborative funding call that will support projects focused on the generation of bioenergy. \n2.To maintain and enhance coherence and networking between national bioenergy programmes across the EU.\n3.To further the demonstration of enhanced bioenergy technologies in order to help develop robust project plans for a range of demonstrator and flagship plants, that will help Europe to make progress towards achieving its 2016 and 2020 energy targets. \n4.To disseminate knowledge gained from the programme and individual projects across the EU.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"691637","fundValue":"22863655","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2020-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
