{"id":"194838","title":"Preventing and responding to conflict: developing EU CIVilian CAPabilities for a sustainable peace","abstractText":"The goals of preventing the outbreak of conflict and promoting sustainable peace remain a fundamental challenge to policymakers and analysts alike. The European Union (EU) and its member states require an adequate set of capabilities if they are to address this challenge in a timely and effective manner. EU-CIVCAP will provide a comprehensive, comparative and multidisciplinary analysis of EU civilian capabilities for external conflict prevention and peacebuilding in order to identify ‘the best civilian means to enhance these capabilities’ and address existing shortfalls. More specifically, this project has identified three inter-related objectives: (1) To assess EU civilian capabilities for external conflict prevention and peace building; (2) To identify and document lessons learned and best practices in EU conflict prevention and peacebuilding; (3) To enhance future policy practice and research on EU conflict prevention and peacebuilding. The project will gather, synthesise, further develop and disseminate knowledge and learning on civilian conflict prevention and peacebuilding. This will be done through, inter alia, the development of a catalogue of lessons learned and best practices reports, the creation of an expert network, engagement through social media, and the organisation of dissemination events in different formats in this area.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"653227","fundValue":"1714975","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","dataset":"h2020"}
