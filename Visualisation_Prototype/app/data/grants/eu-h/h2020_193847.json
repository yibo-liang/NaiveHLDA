{"id":"193847","title":"Water Works 2014-2019 in Support of the Water JPI","abstractText":"Water is a critical resource for the European society. Beside its main life function, freshwater also provides many other functions essential to our economy. Water challenges cannot be successfully tackled through the isolated effort of individual national research and innovation programmes. This ERA-NET cofund proposal is submitted in the name of the Joint Programming Initiative “Water Challenges for a Changing World”, and aims at contributing to tackle European water challenges through the development of transnational and trans-disciplinary research and innovation actions. WaterWorks2014 addresses the specific challenge of integrating the efforts and Strategic Agendas of many European Water Research and Innovation funding organizations. This ERA-NET cofund will implement a Call for proposals on “research and innovation developing technological solutions and services to support the implementation of EU water policy, in particular for water distribution and measurement, waste water treatment and reuse, desalination, floods and droughts etc.” This Call for proposals will be funded by 18 organizations from 16 countries, and will have a total budget of 15.2 million Euro. This total budget includes a cofund from the European Commission amounting to 5.0 million Euro. WaterWorks2014 will also perform additional activities contributing to Water JPI Strategy and Implementation. Activities contributing to strategy include the development of new versions of the Water JPI Strategic Agenda and the Implementation Plan. Activities contributing to implementation include sharing good practices on Water research and innovation funding and management, exploratory workshops, alignment of on-going projects and the monitoring and final evaluation of Calls without cofunding. WaterWorks2014 will benefit researchers, policy-makers, water authorities, utility operators, industry, farmers, and citizens by developing new solutions to water challenges.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"641715","fundValue":"18667631","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2020-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
