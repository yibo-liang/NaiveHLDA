{"id":"193955","title":"Research Training Network on Integrated Component Cycling in Epithelial Cell Motility","abstractText":"Cell migration (cell motility) is a fundamental biological process that is pivotal in (i) tissue formation and repair (health) and (ii) tissue invasion during carcinogenesis (disease). Understanding and controlling cell migration will have major clinical impact. Clarifying mechanisms driving cell motility has been challenging due to the complex underlying cellular mechanisms; these involve multiple components coordinated by structural, chemical and physical signals in terms of time and space. To accomplish breakthroughs in this field, researchers are needed who (i) master cutting-edge experimental techniques for monitoring the different cellular processes at high resolution and (ii) have competencies in theoretical science for integrating the resulting data sets into mechanistic mathematical models for predicting motile cell behaviour.\nThe Research Training Network on Integrated Component Cycling in Epithelial Cell Motility (InCeM) aims to endow up-and-coming researchers with exactly these competencies. They will be able to develop and apply innovative devices for microscopic recording, image processing techniques, data analysis tools and modelling procedures for mechanistic understanding of cell migration. InCeM will focus on epithelial cells, since inducing motility in this cell type is clinically relevant for wound healing and cancer invasion. The ultimate goal is to control and manipulate cell migration for clinical applications. A dedicated multidisciplinary team of 11 beneficiaries from universities (4), research institutions (4) and industry (3), based in 5 European countries and Israel, together with 17 associated partners from the public and private sector, will train 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) to use the relevant technologies and sciences and will offer business training to prepare them for successful careers in both academic and non-academic environments.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"642866","fundValue":"3884019,12","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
