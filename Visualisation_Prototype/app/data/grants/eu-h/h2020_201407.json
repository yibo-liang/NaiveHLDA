{"id":"201407","title":"Predictive Energy Management in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","abstractText":"Plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) offer an ample alternative for low-carbon road mobility, which however impose a significantly challenge on maximising energy efficiency and driving autonomy. This pPHEV project aims at addressing this challenge by developing a predictive energy management system for PHEVs as well as realise an advanced career development for the experienced researcher using a clearly defined training-through-research approach. This proposed predictive control management will benefit from and integrate driver driving style information, and dynamic traffic and speed information within this project, along with a few on-going vehicle electrification and intelligence research activities at Cranfield University. This fellowship provides an excellent opportunity for the experienced researcher to advance the career training to secure a leading independent position at the end of the fellowship. The research outcomes will offer a step change in PHEV energy management, and promote knowledge sharing among different EV/HEV-related communities. The pPHEV project will not only advance the research, innovation and development of future PHEVs, but will also improve public awareness of smart green transport.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"706253","fundValue":"146591,1","fundStart":"2017-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","dataset":"h2020"}
