{"id":"195603","title":"[18F]Fluorination of alkylCF3 and alkylCF2CF3 chains-Application to hypoxia biomarkers for PET imaging.","abstractText":"The first objective of this proposal is to provide a solution to a well recognized problem in 18F-radiochemistry: the direct [18F]fluorination of trifluoromethylated and perfluorinated (CF2-CF3) alkyl chains. We propose to investigate a copper-mediated fluorination of alkyl boronic species using [18F]fluoride. The value of this new radiochemistry will be challenged with the synthesis and the labelling of two well-known and promising biomarkers for hypoxia, EF3 and EF5. We propose to develop an automated protocol for the production of their radiolabelled counterparts, and to perform a pre-clinical comparative study of [18F]EF3 and [18F]EF5 with [18F]FMISO, the current hypoxia biomarker used for PET imaging.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"658405","fundValue":"195454,8","fundStart":"2015-03-16","fundEnd":"2017-03-15","dataset":"h2020"}
