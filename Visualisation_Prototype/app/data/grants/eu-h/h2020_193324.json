{"id":"193324","title":"Opening the cycling and walking tracking potential","abstractText":"This project will explore the potential of walking and cycling tracking services to promote walking and cycling mobility. We will focus on established walking and cycling promotion measures and thoroughly assess the potential of ICT based tracking services to overcome barriers to implementation and finding new factors driving the effectiveness of those measures. Through specific research, the related ICT challenges like scheme dynamics, privacy, trust, low-cost, interoperability and flexibility will be tackled for each type of measure. The measures to target will be established measures to promote walking and cycling travel to workplace, shopping, school and leisure promotion measures. We will investigate both the ability that tracking tools may have to address traditional challenges of these measures and their potential to bring new features in the fields of awareness raising, financial/tax incentives, infrastructure planning and service concepts. A common, flexible and open access tool will be developed to provide an ICT input and output platform that addresses the related ICT challenges. Over this platform it will be easy for anyone to build products based on tracking services tailored to the requirements of the specific measures. This project will develop and test a representative set of such products in real measures underway. These test cases will at the same time validate and provide additional inputs for the project’s research issues and trigger the widespread of tracking services to support walking and cycling measures in Europe.\nUsers, policy makers and walking and cycling practitioners and final users will be deeply involved in all stages of the project.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"635266","fundValue":"2896984,75","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","dataset":"h2020"}
