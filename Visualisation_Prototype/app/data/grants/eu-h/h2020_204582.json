{"id":"204582","title":"A disruptive mobile photovoltaic array that can pack up to 20kWp of generating power into a domestic trailer and 100kWp of generating power into an ISO 20-foot shipping container.","abstractText":"Transient power generation in remote locations is cost-intensive and subject to fuel shortages, and renewable alternatives are unable to compete with diesel generators used at these sites, either in terms of durability or generation capacity. The Renovagen RollArray is a rollable thin-film solar array using cutting-edge photovoltaic technology. Each rolling solar array integrates battery banks to provide continuous energy outside of solar peak times, and motorised re-spooling to allow rapid redeployment. RollArray systems are capable of providing up to 100kWp of electrical power, and offer superior low-light performance to contemporary mobile PV solutions. This makes them perfectly suited to exploratory and disaster situations where consistency and stability of power supply are paramount, due to a high financial and potential unacceptably high human cost, respectively. RollArray eliminates the fuel transport costs and environmental concerns of diesel generator use, does not require a solar engineer for set-up, deploys in less than 10 minutes, and provides up to 10x the generating capacity of other mobile PV solutions.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"728378","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2016-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","dataset":"h2020"}
