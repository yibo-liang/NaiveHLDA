{"id":"193185","title":"Toolless Manufacturing of Complex Structures","abstractText":"Lithography based additive manufacturing technologies (L-AMT) are capable of fabricating parts with excellent surface quality, good feature resolution and precision. ToMax aims at developing integrated lithography-based additive manufacturing systems for the fabrication of ceramic parts with high shape complexity. The focus of the project is to unite industrial know-how in the field of software development, photopolymers and ceramics, high-performance light-sources, system integration, life cycle analysis, industrial exploitation and rewarding end-user cases.\n\nThe consortium will provide 3D-printers with high throughput and outstanding materials and energy efficiency. The project is clearly industrially driven, with 8 out of 10 partner being SMEs or industry.\n\nTargeted end-use applications include ceramics for aerospace engineering, medical devices and energy efficient lighting applications. The consortium is aiming to exploit disruptive applications of L-AMT by developing process chains beyond the current state of the art, with the dedicated goal to provide manufacturing technologies for European Factories of the Future.\nBy relying on L-AMT,  ToMax the following objectives are targeted: \n(1) ToMax will provide methods which are 75% more material efficient with respect to traditional manufacturing.\n(2) Are 25% more material efficient with respect to current AMT approaches by using computational modelling to optimize geometries and by providing recyclable wash-away supports.\n(3) ToMax will provide methods which are 35% more energy efficient that current AMT approaches by developing 50% faster thermal processing procedures.\n(4) Incorporate recycling for the first time in L-AMT of engineering ceramics.\n\nOverall, the consortium will provide innovative, resource efficient manufacturing processes. ToMax will develop energy-efficient machinery and processes, with a focus on manufacturing of alumina, silicon nitride and cermet parts with high shape complexity.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"633192","fundValue":"3157986","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","dataset":"h2020"}
