{"id":"198872","title":"Enterprising Students Accreditation Platform for Europe","abstractText":"The Enterprising Students Accreditation (ESA) is a programme that has run for three years in the UK and has grown to now involve over 110,000 students annually. At present it is based on a simple online platform with limited functionality. Through the building of our European network we have identified a clear business opportunity to build a pan-European ESA network with programmes managed locally in each country. This project is centred on designing, testing and building a new ESSA Platform with increased functionality, capabilities and localisation. This will greatly increase revenue generation both centrally and for local partners, beneficially impact on youth unemployment, create a large student-specific network and positively contribute to our access to talent, profile and ultimately our position as a European seed finance venture fund. To achieve this we now need to apply focus to testing our model, validating the practical and financial feasibility and widening our EU awareness.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"696671","fundValue":"71429","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","dataset":"h2020"}
