{"id":"193863","title":"Indium-Free Transparent Conductive Oxides for Glass and Plastic Substrates","abstractText":"INFINITY will develop an inorganic alternative to a scarce and high cost material, indium tin oxide (ITO), currently used as a Transparent Conductive Coating (TCC) for display electrodes on glass and plastic substrates. The novel conductive materials to be developed in this project will be based on low cost sol-gel chemistry using more widely available metallic elements and will leverage recent advances in nanostructured coatings. Novel printing procedures will also be developed to enable direct writing of multi and patterned nano-layers, removing the waste associated with etch patterning.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"641927","fundValue":"4003243,06","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
