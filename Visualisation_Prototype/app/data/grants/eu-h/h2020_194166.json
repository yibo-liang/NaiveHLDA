{"id":"194166","title":"Realising an Applied Gaming Eco-system","abstractText":"The EU based industry for non-leisure games (applied games) is an emerging business. As such, it´s still fragmented and needs critical mass to compete globally. Nevertheless its growth potential is widely recognised and even suggested to exceed the growth potential of the leisure games market.\n\nRAGE will help to seize these opportunities by making available 1) an interoperable set of advanced technology assets tuned to applied gaming 2) proven practices of using asset-based applied games in various real-world contexts, 3) centralised access to a wide range of applied gaming software modules, services and resources, 4) an online social space (the RAGE Ecosystem) that arranges and facilitates  collaboration that underlie progress and innovation, 5) workshops and online training opportunities for both developers and educators, 6) assets-based business cases that support the games industry at seizing new business opportunities, and 7) a business model and launch plan for exploiting the RAGE Ecosystem beyond the project´s duration.\n\nIntermediary organisations and education providers anticipate a wider exploitation of RAGE results among their end-users, which add up to over 1 million, and through disseminating RAGE in their partner networks. The game companies in RAGE anticipate adding RAGE-based products to their portfolio, in order to improve their competitive advantage by opening a new product line for applied games and developing new revenue streams.\n\nActual deployment of RAGE results will generate direct impact on the competitive positioning of the few thousand of European SMEs in the Applied Games market. Impacts  from RAGE will be visible in terms of fulfilling new client needs by quicker and more challenging methods of skills acquisition, enabling new business models based on the usage of the assets repository and the Ecosystem, and in the strengthening  collaboration  across the entire Applied Games value chain.","grantUrl":"","grantId":"644187","fundValue":"8999942,5","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","dataset":"h2020"}
